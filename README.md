# Sample App (Hartl Rails Tutorial)

My take on the Sample App, a blogging application, developed through the canonical [Hartl tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book).

## Running Sample App

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone it to your machine
3. Bundle install all gems `$ bundle install`
4. Setup database
  1. `$ rails db:create`
  2. `$ rails db:migrate`
  3. `$ rails db:seed`
5. Start a rails server `$ rails s`
